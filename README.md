# The Daily Buzz Rainfall Prediction Project

## Overview
The case study revolves around a newspaper company called "The Daily Buzz" based in Sydney, Australia. The company wants to introduce a new weather prediction column called "The Weather Oracle" to attract more readers and stay ahead of the competition. To achieve accurate weather predictions, specifically for rainfall, the editor-in-chief has hired you as a machine learning expert to create a machine learning model.

## Objective
The primary objective is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict rainfall in Sydney using various classification models, including decision trees and ensemble methods. The model with the best accuracy score will be selected for deployment in "The Weather Oracle" column.

## Background
The Daily Buzz has been struggling to attract more readers and maintain a competitive edge. The introduction of "The Weather Oracle" column is seen as an opportunity to provide a unique and useful service to the community. The newspaper has a team of experienced meteorologists who have been working on weather forecasting, but they want to leverage machine learning techniques to further improve the accuracy of their rainfall predictions.

## Tools Used

- Anaconda
- Microsoft VS-code
- Jyupter Notebook
- Python Libraries
- MS-Excel

## Approach
The approach outlined in the case study is as follows:

### Data Preprocessing: 
- Load the provided weather dataset for Sydney (from 2008 to 2017) and perform necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps.

### Model Training:
  - Train a decision tree classifier model on the preprocessed data.
  - Implement ensemble methods like bagging (Random Forest Classifier) and boosting (Gradient Boosting Classifier) techniques.
  - Train and evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy score and confusion matrix.

### Model Selection: 
- Select the model with the best accuracy score as the final model for rainfall prediction.

### Analysis and Improvement:
  - Analyze the reasons behind the superior performance of the selected model.
  - Explore potential steps or techniques to further improve the accuracy of the selected model.

### Documentation: 
Document the entire process, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and analysis, in a Jupyter Notebook. Additionally, answer the following questions within the notebook:
  - Your views about the problem statement
  - Your approach to solving the task
  - Available machine learning model options
  - Reasons for the best-performing model's superiority
  - Steps to improve the selected model's performance

## Conclusion
The case study aims to leverage machine learning techniques, specifically classification models and ensemble methods, to develop an accurate rainfall prediction model for Sydney. By analyzing historical weather data and training various models, the objective is to identify the best-performing model that can be integrated into "The Weather Oracle" column. The entire process, along with detailed analysis and documentation, will be presented in a Jupyter Notebook, providing a comprehensive solution to the problem statement.
